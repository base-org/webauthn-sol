    ///      Please carefully read through this list before usage.

    ///      Specifically, we do verify the following:
    ///         - Verify that authenticatorData (which comes from the authenticator, such as iCloud Keychain) indicates
    ///           a well-formed assertion with the user present bit set. If `requireUV` is set, checks that the authenticator
    ///           enforced user verification. User verification should be required if, and only if, options.userVerification
    ///           is set to required in the request.
    ///         - Verifies that the client JSON is of type "webauthn.get", i.e. the client was responding to a request to
    ///           assert authentication.
    ///         - Verifies that the client JSON contains the requested challenge.
    ///         - Verifies that (r, s) constitute a valid signature over both the authenicatorData and client JSON, for public
    ///            key (x, y).
    ///
    ///      We make some assumptions about the particular use case of this verifier, so we do NOT verify the following:
    ///         - Does NOT verify that the origin in the `clientDataJSON` matches the Relying Party's origin: tt is considered
    ///           the authenticator's responsibility to ensure that the user is interacting with the correct RP. This is
    ///           enforced by most high quality authenticators properly, particularly the iCloud Keychain and Google Password
    ///           Manager were tested.
    ///         - Does NOT verify That `topOrigin` in `clientDataJSON` is well-formed: We assume it would never be present, i.e.
    ///           the credentials are never used in a cross-origin/iframe context. The website/app set up should disallow
    ///           cross-origin usage of the credentials. This is the default behaviour for created credentials in common settings.
    ///         - Does NOT verify that the `rpIdHash` in `authenticatorData` is the SHA-256 hash of the RP ID expected by the Relying
    ///           Party: this means that we rely on the authenticator to properly enforce credentials to be used only by the correct RP.
    ///           This is generally enforced with features like Apple App Site Association and Google Asset Links. To protect from
    ///           edge cases in which a previously-linked RP ID is removed from the authorised RP IDs, we recommend that messages
    ///           signed by the authenticator include some expiry mechanism.
    ///         - Does NOT verify the credential backup state: this assumes the credential backup state is NOT used as part of Relying
    ///           Party business logic or policy.
    ///         - Does NOT verify the values of the client extension outputs: this assumes that the Relying Party does not use client
    ///           extension outputs.
    ///         - Does NOT verify the signature counter: signature counters are intended to enable risk scoring for the Relying Party.
    ///           This assumes risk scoring is not used as part of Relying Party business logic or policy.
    ///         - Does NOT verify the attestation object: this assumes that response.attestationObject is NOT present in the response,
    ///           i.e. the RP does not intend to verify an attestation.
    ///

    /// @param requireUV    A boolean indicating whether user verification is required.
    /// @param webAuthnAuth The `WebAuthnAuth` struct.
